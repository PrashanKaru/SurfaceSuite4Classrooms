## Project Background
We were initially assigned by UCL to the ‘UCL CS surface studio and surface table project’, which with further refinements we became the Table-Tablet team at UCL and we are introducing to you our 10th Anniversary Microsoft Surface Libraries. With the celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the Surface Suite line of products at Microsoft upon us, we may tend to look towards the current technologies that are at the forefront of technological advancements such as the Microsoft Surface Studio as well as technologies for instance that integrate cognitive services. Often it is easy to overlook how far the technology has come and how old technology is still very viable in the current day. At the origin of the Surface product line is the Microsoft Surface Table, which introduced the world to multi-touch on a much more functional level making use of a variety of innovative gestures and controls where 10 years on the hardware is still reliable in this day and age.

From the requirements set by our clients Dr. Dean Mohamedally and Geoff Hughes We’ve created a Table-Tablet hybrid system that aimed to engineer a metaphor for education and medical research purposes. Nowadays it is hard to avoid the futuristic visions in television of interactive surfaces communicating with other various devices but where is the reality of this and where are the libraries in the real world today? Our project from the requirements of our clients is not only to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Surface Product line it demonstrates with a library available to the public it shows how using a table top and modern web-based technologies such as Node.js and to build an application that has a genuine use in the real world for mobile and tablet users. The foundation of the project is to demonstrate the compatibility between multiple Windows devices.

 In our case this involves the ten-year-old Surface 1.0, a multi-touch interactive table-top computer, running the Vista operating system, an unsupported version of Windows. The project involved safely upgrading this device to the new Windows 10, without any data loss from the original device state, while retaining the multi-touch capabilities that the device had on Windows Vista then proceeding to create a set of libraries to allow real-time communication between the Surface 1.0 and another computer, hosted in Microsoft Azure and finally creating an application to demonstrate the features implemented.
 Project Goals
Below are our 3 key project goals. When defining our project goals we aimed to ensure that they fit the constraints of a SMART model for setting goals. This model aims to ensure that all aspects of the goal are ‘Specific’, ‘Measurable’, ‘Attainable’, ‘Relevant’ and are ‘Time Bound’.
	
### Table Upgrade:
Our foremost goal when starting this project was to upgrade the table to Windows 10, as this conceptually proved to be the bottleneck of the rest of the project where progress was halted until this was complete. In terms of a SMART goal structure this very easily categorised itself as it is very specific, measurable (by the fact of where the table is running the OS) and a reasonably attainable goal as there were guides online demonstrating this upgrade to Windows 8. Lastly our goal of upgrading the table to Windows 10 is very relevant to the project by demonstrating how old technology copes in the current day as well as is time restricted by our need to develop the application and back end. 

### Suitable application:
Parallel to upgrading the table to Windows 10 we needed to decide on a concept and flesh out to demonstrate the use of decade old technology in this generation.
Hence our key goals with the application was to:

Find a suitable application idea for an ideal target market that shows the optimum capabilities of this system working in tandem for a real world application. This followed the SMART framework as it is specific in the sense that we needed it to demonstrate a real world use with a desired target market. Similarly it is measurable and achievable in whether our clients deemed it suitable to demonstrating a real world application. It is also relevant as this goal in itself is ensuring that our application is relevant to the task, and lastly with the time basis of having to determine this idea fully within the first 4 weeks of the project we had a desired time frame.

Create a front end and back end that has the required functionalities, such that useful information and meaningful information is passed between them to demonstrate that old technology is still very capable of working with new technologies to create usable hardware systems. In order to make this goal specific, we aim to design an application that managed to pass at minimum 3 variables in total from the client on the Surface Studio and the Surface Table or vice versa within the time frame of the development of the Front end, Back end and Application which spans the time frame of the entire project, hence it conforms to the SMART goals guidelines.

### Universally usable Back End:
We aim to create a Back End and a set of libraries that are open sourced which allow for anybody to develop systems using the back end framework that we have put in place.	This adapts the SMART framework when we give it the following constraints. Our goal is to create a set of open source libraries that will be made available through GitHub such that the code and methods provided will allow a typical user will be able to create a Table - Tablet hybrid system with the back end that we provide, once again complete by the overall given deadline of the project.
